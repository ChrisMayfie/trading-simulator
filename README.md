# Trading Simulator: Momentum and Mean Reversion Strategies

This project is a Python-based backtesting simulator that runs and compares two classic algorithmic trading strategies: momentum and mean reversion. It uses real historical stock data (AAPL, MSFT, GOOG) and visualizes both performance metrics and individual trades.

## üìà Features

- Backtest two strategies across multiple stocks
- Real equity data from Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)
- Cumulative profit & loss tracking
- Clear matplotlib visualizations with annotated trades
- Side-by-side trade table comparison
- Modular structure for strategy experimentation

## üß† Strategies

### Momentum
Buys if the price has increased over a recent window. Sells if it has declined.

### Mean Reversion
Buys if the price drops significantly below its moving average. Sells if it rises above.

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- pandas
- matplotlib
- yfinance
